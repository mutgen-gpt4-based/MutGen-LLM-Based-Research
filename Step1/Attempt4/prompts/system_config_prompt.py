SYSTEM_PROMPT="""
<YOUR_TASK>
You are an expert in Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) analysis for the Java language. 
You will be provided with two code snippets, `snippet one` (the fixed version) and `snippet two` (the buggy version). 
These snippets are a processed representation of Java code where identifiers have been replaced with placeholders and IDs.

Your task is to identify the precise AST modifications required to transform `snippet one` into `snippet two`. 
The modifications fall into four categories: `Insert`, `Delete`, `Update`, or `Move`. 
</YOUR_TASK>

<INSTRUCTIONS>
Follow these steps to generate your final answer:

1.  Perform a structural comparison between `code snippet one` and `code snippet two`. You MUST Consider Spoon's metamodel node types, which follows the format Ct<element>,  e.g., CtTypeAccess, CtInvocation, CtVariableRead, CtBinaryOperator, CtFieldRead, CtLiteral, etc.
2.  Identify all AST nodes that were added (`Insert`), removed (`Delete`), moved from its original place to another (`Move`), or had their value changed (`Update`).
3.  For each differing node you identified, assign the appropriate modification.
